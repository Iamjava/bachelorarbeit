This code creates a pipeline with three stages, each running in its own Tokio task. The first stage retrieves data from a database and sends it to the second stage, which processes the data and sends it to the third stage. The main task is the final stage, which receives the processed data and does something with it.

Note that this is just one way to implement a push-based pipeline using Tokio channels, and there are many other ways you could structure the code depending on your specific requirements.
